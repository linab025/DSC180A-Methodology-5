**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter**
The most interesting topic has been understanding how proxies can be used to predict a latent variable. It's intersting to see how 
differnet clustering methods allow for this to happen and how it can be executed on different types of datasets. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
It would be interesting to take the clustering algorithm that we are working on, applying it to new datasets and then seeing whether we can figure out why these groupings are happening. To better understand whether there are equal groupings within these dataset, or whether there is something that distinguishes a group that should be addressed in a specific context. 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
Making sure to have the paper and source code early on. It took us a while to figure out what we wanted to focus on and then figure out which paper should be replicated and to completely understand the algorithm that is being proposed. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be interested in data augmentation to see if we could address any unfairness in the groupings that are found.
